# Archlinux-Install-Guide
A simple step by step command guide for archlinux install that works for me(and probably will work for you too). 

I'm uploading it here as a backup.

## Just follow the commands in the [guide](guide.md) and if you are not sure about something , look it up in the arch wiki.
