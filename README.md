# Archlinux-Install-Guide
A simple step by step command guide for archlinux install that works for me(and probably will work for you too). 

I'm uploading it here as a backup. The install is for a BIOS with MBR(dos) based system.

## Just follow the commands in the [guide](guide.md) and if you are not sure about something , look it up in the arch wiki.
## The commands in the [guide](guide.md) are now compiled into a shell script, check out [the script here](install_script.sh).
## (NOTE:It is suggested to run the script in a VM and check that everything works for you before running it on real hardware. )
